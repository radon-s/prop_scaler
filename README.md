# Prop scaler
Scales decompiled source model files (.qc) and then compiles them

Type 1 for scaling all the .qc files in a folder

Type 2 for scaling a single .qc file

'Path: '
- Enter the folder where you decompiled your models
- Should contain both .qc files and .smd (also idle models if the model had any)

'New folder: '
- Enter the new folder where you want the compiled model to be, this will allways be in \cstrike\models

'Name: ' 
- Enter the name of the .qc file (dont include .qc)
- Only asked if you type 2

'Scale: '
- Enter the scale of the model (can include decimals)
- Only asked once per Path, so if you type 1 all the .qc files will be scaled the same

Let me know if you have any problems:
